	"whatIsPlatooning": "What is platooning?",
	"whatIsPlatooningParagraph": "Platooning is a method of driving where a group of vehicles drive in a line, with the vehicles in the front of the line controlling the speed of the vehicles behind them. This is done to reduce fuel consumption and increase safety by adjusting the space between the vehicles.",
	"howSimulationWorks": "How does this simulation work?",
	"howSimulationWorksParagraph": "This simulation uses a simple model of platooning to simulate the vehicles. The vehicles are controlled by a PID controller, which uses the distance between the vehicle and the vehicle in front of it to calculate the speed of the vehicle. The PID controller is tuned to give the vehicles a comfortable distance between them, and to keep the vehicles at a constant speed.",
